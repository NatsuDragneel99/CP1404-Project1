# CP1404 2017 SP1 Assignment 1
Assignment 1 for CP1404, 2017 SP1, IT@JCU

1. How long did the entire project (assignment 1) take you?
> I would estimate that the project took me between 15 - 20 hours to complete. This is based off knowing the days I worked and how long I might work for in a single session. This time was spread out over little more than a week.


2. What do you plan to do  differently in your development process for assignment 2?
> Whilst I planned heavily before typing my first piece of code, my insight of how much exactly the project would encompass, was off. I encountered errors early on, which whilst easily fixed, wouldn't work without first breaking something else. I believe this was the result of improper planning, where I failed to map out every interaction the program might take to accomplish its goal. I am also disappointed in the final result of my functions. I believe my functions aren't as flexible as they should be and that I didn't entirely grasp the concept the function that worked seamlessly, anywhere. I look forward to avoiding, and improving past these faults as best I can in assignment 2.
